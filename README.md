# UnityGame

Hello! My name is Lee Aguilar. I am an aspiring game developer who loves programming and designing games like this one! I'm using the Unity game engine and programming in C#.

This is my first full attempt at making a game using Unity C#. This is my passion and I love creating / designing them!

This game is called "Endless Roller" I started a similar project for my schools game expo that we had. It was basic and not as well developed as this that I have, but, it was my first time using unity and actually writing code for games (not drag and play). That game got first place in the game expo! I was amazed and I knew from that point I wanted to do this. Since then I wanted to develop that game more, I scratched the whole design and re-did that, and then I also added more features in the game like jumping, coins, and more.
